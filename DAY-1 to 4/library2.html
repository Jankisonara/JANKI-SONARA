        Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he
        lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered
        a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in
        decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old
        farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too
        dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.

        Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on
        a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something
        scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her
        years—promised to protect him, no matter what.

        Venice: The Art of Living

        Venice: The Art of Living
        Text by Frédéric Vitoux,
        Photos by Jérôme Darblay
        Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1991
        Hardcover, 252 pages
        ISBN 1-55670-425-9

        If Venice is the kind of city that inspires coffee-table books, Venice: The Art of Living is the sort of book
        you'd expect to find arranged next to a Sotheby's catalog in a Park Avenue duplex.

        But make no mistake: Handsome as this book may be, with its large glossy format and hundreds of color
        photographs, it's more than just an accessory for the well-appointed living room.
